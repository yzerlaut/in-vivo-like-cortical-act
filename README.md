This module aims at reproducing the synaptic bombardment targetting a single cell in cortical networks. The currents are based on Poisson point processes convoluted with exponential waveforms. For the rationale of such models and similar dynamic-clamp implementation (for in-vitro experiments), see e.g. the (non-exhaustive) following publications :


The config file producing the snapshot (i.e. combined with my LIF-model implementation) can be found on this ![link](https://github.com/yzerlaut/my_rtxi_configs/blob/master/lif-shotnoise-input.set)
